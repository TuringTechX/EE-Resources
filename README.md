# EE-Resources
A list of resources I've found useful for electrical engineering education. Pretty much everything is stored in the README.

## Controls:
### [Brian Douglas](https://www.youtube.com/user/ControlLectures/featured)   
#### This guy has some incredible videos on introductory topics in control theory. I feel like I could have replaced at least two of my Sophomore and Junior courses just with his YouTube channel. He explains topics in a direct and easy to understand way, with minimal fluff. He's so good that he deserves his own section.
- [Classical Control Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk) - Basically a compilation of all of his Controls lectures. 47 videos.
- [Laplace and Fourier Transforms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK3jmgpXCQj3GRxM3u9BmO_v)
- [Bode Plots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK24TCFwngV5MeiruHxt1BQR)
- [The Root Locus Method](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK3-ca6GP6PL0AgcNGHqn33f)
- [Routh-Hurwitz Criterion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK0zTjna57eZX4RoZlJtG3L4)
- [PID Control](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK20UW0yM22HYEUTMJfla7Mb)
- [Lead/Lag Compensators](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK0WzmjRViTYtlSVSE_zP6yR)

## Computer Science & Software Engineering:
### Becoming a Better Devloper
- [Clean Code - Uncle Bob](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj) - Very long, but well worth your time!
### Reference Material

- [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) - A community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types.
### Development Tools
- [Godbolt Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) - Compiles your C-code into assembly, with your choice of compiler.
- [Mimicc](https://mimicc.dev/) - "Mimicc is a clang-based C/C++ compiler and mocking framework that turns function and method declarations directly into runnable mocks."
