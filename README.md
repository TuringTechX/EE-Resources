# EE-Resources
A list of resources I've found useful for electrical engineering education. Pretty much everything is stored in the README, but I may move things into folders if it gets overly cluttered.

# Electrical Engineering Topics
## Controls
### [Brian Douglas](https://www.youtube.com/user/ControlLectures/featured)   
#### This guy has some incredible videos on introductory topics in control theory. I feel like I could have replaced at least two of my Sophomore and Junior courses just with his YouTube channel. He explains topics in a direct and easy to understand way, with minimal fluff. He's so good that he deserves his own section.
- [Classical Control Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk) - Basically a compilation of all of his Controls lectures. 47 videos.
